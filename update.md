# In Git, the process of updating your GitHub repository with changes from your local development environment involves a series of steps. It's not automatic, and you need to manually commit and push changes to GitHub. Here's a general workflow:

1. **Make Changes in Your Local Repository:**
   - Edit, add, or delete files within your project directory.

2. **Stage Changes:**
   - Use the following command to stage the changes you've made:
     ```bash
     git add .
     ```
     This command stages all changes.

3. **Commit Changes:**
   - Commit the staged changes with a descriptive message:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
     ```

4. **Push Changes to GitHub:**
   - Push the committed changes to your GitHub repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin master
     ```
     If you're working on a different branch, replace `master` with the name of your branch.

5. **Enter GitHub Credentials:**
   - If prompted, enter your GitHub username and password. If you've set up SSH authentication, you won't need to enter credentials each time.

Now, your GitHub repository is updated with the changes you made locally. Repeat these steps whenever you want to sync your local changes with the GitHub repository.

### Tips:

- **Branching:**
  - Consider creating branches for different features or bug fixes. This helps keep your main branch (often `master` or `main`) stable.

- **Pull Requests:**
  - When working collaboratively, use pull requests on GitHub to propose changes and have them reviewed before merging into the main branch.

- **Frequent Commits:**
  - Make frequent, smaller commits with clear messages to track changes more effectively.

- **Git Status:**
  - Use `git status` to check the status of your working directory and see which files are modified, staged, or untracked.

### Automation (CI/CD):

For more advanced workflows and automation, consider setting up Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) tools. These tools automatically run tests, build your project, and deploy it when changes are pushed to the repository. Popular CI/CD platforms include GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, and Travis CI.

However, the basic manual workflow outlined above is suitable for smaller projects and personal development.
